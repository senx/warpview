The bucketization process collects\nthe measurements of the original geo time series which fall in each bucket and apply a bucketizer function on those data, thus leading to at most a\nsingle measurement for each bucket.\n\nThe `BUCKETIZE` framework comes with a number of bucketizer which implement very common aggregation functions such as SUM, MIN, MAX, MEAN, etc.\n\n\n\n@param `bucketcount` Number of buckets of the bucketized geo time series.
