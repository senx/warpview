 * This represents the "canonical" version for an extension identifier. Extension ids
 * have to be case-insensitive (due to the marketplace), but we must ensure case
 * preservation because the extension API is already public at this time.
 *
 * For example, given an extension with the publisher `"Hello"` and the name `"World"`,
 * its canonical extension identifier is `"Hello.World"`. This extension could be
 * referenced in some other extension's dependencies using the string `"hello.world"`.
 *
 * To make matters more complicated, an extension can optionally have an UUID. When two
 * extensions have the same UUID, they are considered equal even if their identifier is different.
